## üåæ Farmer's Guide

### Step 1: Create Your Farm Project

**Required Information:**
- **Basic Details**: Farm name, description, location
- **Financial**: Funding goal (how much capital you need)
- **Agricultural Data**:
  - Land size (in acres)
  - Crop type (Vegetables, Grains, Fruits, Livestock, Cash Crops)
  - Soil quality (1-10 rating)
  - Water access (reliable irrigation?)
  - Infrastructure quality (roads, storage, equipment)
  - Market access (distance to buyers)
  - Climate risk assessment

**Automated Valuation Process:**
The system automatically calculates your farm's value using:
- **Base value**: $5,000 per acre
- **Crop multipliers**: Cash crops (2.0x), Livestock (1.8x), Fruits (1.5x), Vegetables (1.2x), Grains (1.0x)
- **Quality score**: Based on soil, water, infrastructure, market access
- **Location bonus**: Prime agricultural regions get multipliers
- **Risk adjustment**: Climate and market risks factored in

**Example Valuation:**
```
25-acre maize farm in Rift Valley:
- Base: 25 √ó $5,000 = $125,000
- Crop multiplier: 1.0x (grains)
- Quality score: 0.85 (very good conditions)
- Location bonus: 1.1x (Rift Valley)
- Total valuation: $116,875
- Share price: $0.117 per token
```

### Step 2: Launch Your Campaign

Once created, your farm:
- Gets listed publicly for investors
- Shows scientific valuation and share price
- Displays funding progress in real-time
- Attracts investors based on metrics

### Step 3: Manage Your Farm

**During Funding:**
- Monitor investment progress
- Respond to investor questions
- Update project status

**After Funding:**
- Begin farm operations
- Provide regular updates to investors

### Step 4: Harvest & Profit Distribution

**Recording Harvest:**
```
Total Yield: 750 bags of maize
Revenue: $75,000 (from crop sales)
Expenses: $25,000 (seeds, labor, equipment)
Net Profit: $50,000
Quality Grade: Grade A
```

**Profit Sharing:**
- **Farmer's share**: Typically 30% ($15,000)
- **Investor share**: 70% ($35,000)
- **Automatic distribution**: Proportional to token holdings

**Example for $5,000 investor:**
- Owns 42,735 tokens (4.27% of farm)
- Receives: $35,000 √ó 4.27% = $1,495
- ROI: 29.9% in one season!
